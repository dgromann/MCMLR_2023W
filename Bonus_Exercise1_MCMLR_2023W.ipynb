TF-IDF represents an effective method for extracting features from text without any supervision. In documents, there are usually some terms that occur frequently, but might not represent the best features for identifying categories or topics in a document. Instead, TF-IDF assigns higher values to words that occur frequently in one document, but not in all documents. Thereby, they provide more and better information on the potential contents of a document than rare frequency counts. Originally, the technique was used for ranking documents in search engines. Today, it is still used for topic modeling, i.e., identifying topics of documents automatically, term extraction, etc."
